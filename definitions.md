## Challenge 1: Let's look at definitions

- What is a Virtual Reality Systems?
- What is an Extended Reality (XR) System?
- Which techniques and technologies are relevant for these systems?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Definitions

In 1987, [computer scientists already developed](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/319120.319127) "head-mounted, wide-angle, stereoscopic display systems" which were controlled by an "operator position". "The system provides a multisensory, interactive display environment in which a user can virtually explore a 360-degree synthesized or remotely sensed environment and can viscerally interact with its components."[^1][^2]

Based on this definition, we understand virtual reality as an 
interface to computer graphics interactive environment.

Mixed reality introduces various levels in which the real-world
mixes with the digital graphic system. From fully isolating the user from their
surroundings to allowing them to interact with both worlds.

All techniques relevant to software engineering, linked-data, computer
graphics, and system design are relevant to the task of 
building these systems.

Extended Reality (XR) Systems, including Virtual Reality (VR),
Mixed Reality (MR)
and Augmented Reality (AR), will continue to be
additional interfaces to graphic systems beyond other available interfaces.
Hence, their use will continue to permeate many jobs and industries.

See current example of jobs in this area: [Example jobs](https://uk.indeed.com/q-ar-vr-xr-jobs.html?vjk=4f2ca121ac893c5c)

Knowledge and skills in this area will also open other job opportunities in related areas:

- Creative technologies
- Art
- Computer Graphics

Note many of these jobs also have as requirement to be familiar with
[DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) methodologies for software development, including:

- Source code management and build tools (e.g. Git)
- Containerization platforms (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cloud DevOps tools (e.g. Google Cloud DevOps tools)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Virtual Reality Systems draw on knowledge and skills
relevant to computer graphics.
- This is a well established domain in computer science.
- The development of systems in this domain draw on
common practices of software engineering.
