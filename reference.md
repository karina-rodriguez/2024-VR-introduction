We understand ** virtual reality ** as an 
interface to computer graphics interactive environment. 

** Mixed reality ** introduces various levels in which the real-world
mixes with the digital graphic system. From fully isolating the user from their

All techniques relevant to software engineering, linked-data, computer
graphics, and system design are relevant to the task of 
building these systems.
