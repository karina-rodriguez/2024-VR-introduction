## What is Computer Graphics?

Computer Graphics is a sub-field of Computer Science that focuses on developing techniques for digitally creating, synthesizing, and manipulating visual content.

The term often refers to the study of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics, 
encompassing a wide range of visual content such as images, video, and 3D meshes.
