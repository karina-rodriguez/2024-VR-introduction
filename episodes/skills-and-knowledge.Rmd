## What will we learn in this module?
In this module we will work together to develop and gain 1) **theoretical knowledge**, and 2) **practical experience** of:

- Techniques and technologies employed for building extended Reality (XR) systems,
- Tools to support systems development.
- APIs and programming languages employed to build graphic systsems, e.g. C#, Javascript.

Systems we will build include - but are not restricted to - Virtual Reality systems. 

## Which techniques and technologies?

The techniques and technologies we will cover
include software tools, hardware devices, libraries and  algorithms for 
creating, manipulating and rendering spatial+immersive and interactive 
systems.

These systems can be experienced using Mixed-Reality equipment (but not only).

Most of these systems require knowledge in subjects such as 
computer graphics and multidimensional data which includes
2D and 3D data.


## How will the module enhance your CV

Even if you are not planning to work in the XR or the game industry, this module will provide you with:

- An understanding of the potential of visual environments work in various application areas.
- Awareness of technologies to acquire, process and interact with visual content.
- Skills to develop visual systems to manipulate information through mixed reality technologies.
