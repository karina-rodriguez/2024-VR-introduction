## What key concepts and skills will we explore in this module?
In this module we will work together to develop and gain 1) **knowledge**, and 2) **practical experience** of:

- Methods, tools and technologies used in the development of Extended Reality (XR) systems.
- Utilising game engines to create virtual graphical environments.
- APIs and programming languages used to develop graphical systems, such as C#, GDScript, and JavaScript.


## Which tools will we use?

The techniques and technologies we will explore include software tools, hardware devices, libraries, and a
lgorithms for creating, manipulating, and rendering spatial, immersive, and interactive systems, for example:

- 3D modelling tool (Blender)[https://www.blender.org/]

- Photogrammetry tools to generate 3D models from photographs, e.g. (Zephyr)[https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-photogrammetry-software/]

- Game engines:
  - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). This game engine is free and open-source. It allows
  the game engine to be used on [web browser](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/), and is now available on the [Horizon Store for Meta Quest 3 & Meta Quest Pro](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-editor-horizon-store-early-access-release/)
  - [Unity](https://unity.com/)

These systems can be experienced using Mixed-Reality equipment (but not only).

Most of these systems require knowledge in subjects such as 
computer graphics and multidimensional data which includes
2D and 3D data.


## How will the module enhance your CV

Even if you are not planning to work in the XR or the game industry, this module will provide you with:

- Experience coding in an industry-standard language.
- Ability to design forward-thinking solutions that redefine user interactions in XR. 
- Ability to provide technical support to users with XR technologies.
- Ability to sell XR solutions by understanding client needs.
