## Definitions
- What is a VR System?
- What is an Extended Reality (XR) System?
- Which techniques and technologies are relevant for these systems?


In 1987, [computer scientists developed](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/319120.319127) 
"head-mounted, wide-angle, stereoscopic display systems" that were controlled by the user's position. 
"The system provides a multisensory, interactive display environment in which a user can virtually explore a 360-degree synthesized or remotely sensed environment and can viscerally interact with its components."[^1][^2].

This definition frames Virtual Reality Systems as interfaces to interactive, computer-generated environments.
A Virtual Reality (VR) system immerses users in a fully simulated environment, 
often experienced through devices like headsets, gloves, and motion controllers.

Extended reality, on the other hand, introduces varying degrees of integration between the physical 
world and digital environments. These systems range from fully immersing users in a virtual space to 
enabling interaction with both the real and virtual worlds simultaneously.

Developing these systems involves techniques from software engineering, 
linked data, computer graphics, and system design, 
making these disciplines essential to building immersive environments.

### Why learning VR/XR is important?

Extended Reality (XR) Systems, including Virtual Reality (VR),
Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR), provide a broader set of interactive 
interfaces for graphical systems compared to traditional interfaces. 
As a result, their adoption is expected to increasingly influence a wide range of 
jobs and industries.


See current example of jobs in this area: [Example jobs](https://uk.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22virtual+reality%22&l=&from=searchOnDesktopSerp&vjk=edbccfef412e7ec7)

Knowledge and skills in this area will also open other job opportunities in related areas:

- Creative industries
- Art / Design
- Computer Graphics / Software Development


Many of these jobs also have as requirement to be familiar with
[DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops) methodologies for software development, including:

- Source code management and build tools (e.g. Git)
- Containerization platforms (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cloud DevOps tools (e.g. Google Cloud DevOps tools)
