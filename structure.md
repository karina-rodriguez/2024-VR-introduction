The sessions will take place on Wednesdays at 9-11 am.

12 sessions: 

- **2 hour lecture**: we will discuss a topic, e.g. concepts related to VR or computer graphics.
- **2 hour laboratory**: implementation of concepts reviewed in class in a tutorial. This is mostly student led, and can use different platforms/technologies. You can develop the work from home or come to the session for support.

In total, we expect you are spending 6-8 hours a week in
each of your modules. This is how we account for the credits in each module.

Remember this is a level 6 module.

All tutorials will be available online in the same format as this lecture.
