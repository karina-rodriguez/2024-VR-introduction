::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- To explore a variety of XR experiences that are in the market.
- To brainstorm some ideas to develop within the module.
- To oversee state of the art techniques and technologies.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This tutorial will involve researching existing applications in XR systems,
and start building an understanding the methods and tools involved 
in their development.

Your task will be to produce a one slide presentation/poster to present to others next week.


## What do you need to do?
You can either focus on:

1 - Exploring the literature in the area, for example in leading conferences, magazines and journals in the
area of Computer Graphics as we saw in this lesson. The papers can be related to platforms, 
techniques (e.g. interaction or content creation) or applications.

2 - Exploring the XR applications available on a platform, such as a VR platforms 
such as STEAM, Oculus Store, or a mobile app store: Google Play, etc.

Place particular attention to the challenges
involved in developing such experience.
So might brainstorm what is the process to create such system and what type of
content you might need to use.

## What do you need to prepare?

Next lecture we will present all posters and show a demo/video if you have access to one.

In the presentation, please identify:

- scope of your search, 
- why you selected it, and how you envisage it could be used,
- the components of the system, 
- the process you believe is involved in building it,
- the type of interactions with the content, 
- the challenges involved in developing such system.

Don't forget to cite the paper, application or other reference; and provide a link to it.
