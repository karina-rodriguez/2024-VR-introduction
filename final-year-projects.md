## Augmented reality connecting humans with non-humans

We are running a workshop online in conjunction with the [University of Universities](https://uou.ua.es). 

The workshop offers the opportunity to work alongside architecture students from other countries and other universities. They will be working in the evolution of conceptual ideas for an augmented reality project which seeks to further connect us with the non-humans we share our spaces with. 

 The workshop will consist of three sessions: 

- Session 1 - Introduction (Friday 4th Oct 2025, 12:00 - 12:30 (Teams)): a short half hour introduction, which also sets out the first task and place the students into groups. 
- Session 2 (Friday 11th Oct 8:30 - 12:30): includes a discussion of task one, various talks from researchers on AI and AR,
and time for working within the group of students they are assigned to on ideas for a project. 
- Session 3 (Friday, 18th October, 8:30 - 12:30): involve a review of the project work – which will be a story board of the ideas for the project and final drawings. ** This might be a good one to attend if you only want to hear ideas. **

If you want to participate, please let me know to send you more details.

 
## Final Year Projects

Looking to supervise CI601 projects on:

- Implementing machine learning driven topic modelling using people's diaries from a ([COVID-19 dataset](http://massobs_covid.geodata.soton.ac.uk/projects_database/covid_combined/)).
  - Seminar: Mass Observing COVID-19: A digital resource, Wednesday 9th October, Huxley 407, Speaker: Kirsty Pattrick, Mass Observation Research Manager, Mass Observation Archive, The Keep
